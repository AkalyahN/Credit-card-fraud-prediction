# Credit Card Fraud Detection using Logistic Regression

This project applies **Logistic Regression** to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using a real-world dataset. The goal is to accurately classify transactions as fraudulent or legitimate.

## 📌 Project Overview

Credit card fraud is a major financial threat. In this project, we use machine learning to detect anomalies in transactions. The model is trained using logistic regression, a widely used binary classification algorithm.

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders. It includes:

- 284,807 transactions
- 492 fraudulent cases (highly imbalanced)
- Features are numerical values resulting from a PCA transformation
